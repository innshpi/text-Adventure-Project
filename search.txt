You rustle around the undergrowth and push away some shrubs, 
discovering an ominous trapdoor heading downwards.
;

You walk towards the sound of running water, when suddenly 
you can't move. before you realise what has happened, a 
giant spider with fangs that look big enough to tear a deer 
in half jumps out at you from the darkness.
;

Perched on a particularly sharp stalagmite in the corner of 
the cave is a lifejacket. It may come in handy so you pick it up.
;

You wade through the glistening pools and in the depths of a 
large one is a sword buried underneath some sand.
;

You climb to the top of the largest rock you can find and 
stare into the horizon. You truly feel like an adventurer.
;

You swim out to sea from the shallows, but you get caught in a rip.
;

You found nothing. You feel slightly demoralised for no particular reason
