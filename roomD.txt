You wade up the stream, and when you step out you realise you 
are back at the small field on the hill. You look down the sheer 
cliff and see the sand flats, as well as the rope you placed to 
get down. Somethings different though. In the centre of the field 
is an old door, sitting alone with no building to support it. It 
has no defining characteristics except for a fang shaped hole in 
the centre, about as big as your head
;
You are walking across a barren sand flat, with nothing much in 
sight but sand dunes, and the occasional crab. You look east and 
across the dunes, and you see a small opening in the side of a 
tall rocky cliff. Interested, you walk towards the cave opening. 
South towards the right of the cave opening, is a winding dirt 
path lined with dense trees and shrubs.
;
You descend down into the dark pit below, the only thing keeping 
you from plummeting to the bottom are the rusty steel rungs your 
hands are clasped to. When your feet finally meet the hard stone 
floor, you can see nothing but black. As your eyes slowly adjust 
to the dark, you realise youâ€™re in a vast, empty cavern. You take 
in the scene and your eyes follow the impossibly high walls up to 
the ceiling, which nests thousands of glowworms. Across the rocky 
floor there are patches of thriving moss and in the distance you 
hear the faint echoing of dripping water.
